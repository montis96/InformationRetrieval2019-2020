# InformationRetrieval2019-2020

The explosion of internet and digital repositories make available for everyone a big amount of data 
that is growing by time. It led us in the direction to need different and more dynamic ways to find 
information.  This  problem  has  attracted  several  research  efforts  in  the  Information  Retrieval 
society.  
In this paper we will deal with Lucene, an open source Java library that lets you add search to any 
application.  We will  present  the functionality offered by Lucene and we will  investigate on the 
feasibility of using Lucene to add retrieve capabilities. We will also analyse the impact on retrieval 
performance when implementing Rocchio algorithm for relevance feedback and query expansion 
using an automatically generated thesaurus (Wordnet).
